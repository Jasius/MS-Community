## Frequently Asked Questions
### How do I report something?
Send a private message to **@Moderators mail**, found at the top of the members list. The message should include as much information as you can reasonably provide.

If, in the event of any technical issues, the moderators mail bot is not found at the top of the members list, it will be replaced by the moderators, who in this instance only, you may directly message regarding your issue.
### I got muted! What should I do?
Think about what you‚Äôve done and wait patiently for the mute to expire. If you believe that the mute was unwarranted, message modmail as above and explain clearly and calmly why you believe you shouldn't have been muted.
### Nobody is answering my question or helping me! What should I do?
Firstly, be patient. It might take a while for someone to be able to help you. Furthermore, consider if when you asked you‚Äôve provided as much detail as possible to make it easy for us to help you. If you‚Äôve done this, and you still need help and it‚Äôs been around a day or so and you‚Äôve not had any help, then consider asking again.
### Why does the server icon keep changing?
The server icon is changed to celebrate certain events, usually major holidays or important dates in computing history.
### When is [MS update/product] going to be released?
When Microsoft decide to release it. Use search, since it‚Äôs likely this question will have been asked many, many times before.
### Are those real Microsoft employees?
Yes, they are. They‚Äôre verified through their employee account. However, they aren‚Äôt here on official business and anything they say does not in any way represent Microsoft. They‚Äôre just here like any other user. Don‚Äôt ping them for support unless they‚Äôre actively helping you; it will be considered a violation of rule 5.
