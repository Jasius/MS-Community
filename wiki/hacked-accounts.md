# Getting Live Support for Hacked Accounts

This article covers how to get live chat support in case your account gets hacked.

::: tip Note
We can not help you recover hacked accounts in the Discord server, as we do not have access to account information.
:::

The correct form to use for hacked accounts can be found [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/home/contact?linkquery=I%20think%20my%20Microsoft%20account%20has%20been%20hacked).
Keep in mind that this is not a 100% guarantee to get your account back, having a lot of proof of ownership like receipts is very helpful.

## Filling in the form

1. At the option 'Choose how you normally sign in, then enter your details.', select 'With an email address'.
2. Fill in the email address you normally sign in with and press 'OK'.
