# Installing and Updating Drivers¬†
In this guide, you will learn how to download or update drivers on your computer.

::: warning
It is highly recommended to avoid using third-party software to update or install your drivers.
:::

## Identifying Your Hardware
The first step in installing drivers is to correctly identify the hardware you need drivers for. This information can be found in your computer's manual or by using the Device Manager. You can access the device manager by right-clicking the Windows start button or by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> and selecting Device Manager. In the Device Manager, look for the device you require drivers for, and expand its entry to see its model number.

You can also use the System Information tool to find hardware information; open System Information, navigate to the ‚ÄúHardware‚Äù section and find the device you require drivers for.

## Method 1: Using Windows Update
You can usually find drivers for your devices in Windows Update, instead of having to manually download the file.

1. Open Settings via the start menu or by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>.
¬†
2. Go to Update & Security (on Windows 10) or Windows Update (on Windows 11).
¬†
3. Click on ‚ÄúCheck for Updates‚Äù or "Download & Install Updates".
¬†

Windows Update might say that you are up-to-date, even if optional updates are available. You can check for additional optional updates in the 'Optional updates' section of Windows Update settings.

On Windows 11:

1. Click "Advanced options".

2. Click "Optional updates".

   <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-advanced-options-optional-updates.png" alt="The Advanced options menu, with the Optional updates button highlighted." width="500px">

3. Click "Driver updates" to show the list of available driver updates, if there are any.

   <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-optional-updates-driver-updates.png" alt="The Optional updates menu, with the Driver updates menu highlighted." width="500px">

4. Select any optional updates you wish to install, then click "Download & install".

   <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-driver-update-example.png" alt="An available optional driver update, with the Download & install button selected." width="500px">

On Windows 10, a "View optional updates" link will appear under "Check for updates" if optional updates are available. Click on it to see the list of available driver updates.

## Method 2: Using your OEM's website
::: tip Note
"OEM" here refers to the manufacturer of an entire device, like a laptop or pre-built desktop. If you are using a custom-built computer, you should follow [Method 3](#method-3-using-your-manufacturer-s-website) instead.
:::

It is highly recommended to download or update your drivers through your manufacturer's website, as that will guarantee proper functionality, provided you've installed the correct drivers. This is especially a good idea for your Graphics Card (GPU) Drivers.

All you need to do is:
1. On the search engine of your choice (Google, Bing, etc‚Ä¶), search for "{device manufacturer} drivers".
2. Visit the manufacturer's website and enter the model of your device, then follow the instructions on the page.
3. When you select the product, you may be shown with 2 options:
	- Download the driver downloader (recommended).
	- Download this specific driver only and install manually.

- [HP](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers)
¬†
- [Lenovo](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en)

- [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/support/download-center)


## Method 3: Using your manufacturer's website
::: tip Note
"Manufacturer" here refers to the manufacturer of an individual piece of hardware. If you are using a laptop or a pre-built desktop, you should probably download drivers from your OEM's website instead. See [Method 2](#method-2-using-your-oem-s-website).
:::

For each piece of hardware in your computer that you wish to get drivers for:
1. On the search engine of your choice (Google, Bing, etc‚Ä¶), search for "{hardware manufacturer} drivers".
¬†
2. Search for the model number of the piece of hardware you want to upgrade/install drivers for.
¬†
3. When you select the product, you may have two options:
¬†
    - Download the driver downloader (recommended).
    - Download this specific driver only and install manually.

   4. Finally, click "Startup Settings" and then "Restart".

      <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/winre/advanced_options_screen.png" alt="A screenshot of the Advanced Options menu in the Windows Recovery Environment, with the Startup Settings button highlighted." width="500px">

   After your computer restarts, press <kbd>4</kbd> to boot into Safe Mode, or <kbd>5</kbd> to boot into Safe Mode with internet access.

   **On earlier versions of Windows:**

   - Restart your computer and repeatedly press F8 before the Windows logo appears.
   - At the Advanced Boot Options menu, select ‚ÄúSafe Mode‚Äù to boot into Safe Mode, or ‚ÄúSafe Mode with Networking‚Äù to boot into Safe Mode with internet access.

2. Uninstall the Driver in Safe Mode:

   Once in safe mode, you can uninstall the problematic driver:

   1. Open the Device Manager (search for it in the Start Menu).

   2. Expand the category for the device with the recently installed driver.

      <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/troubleshooting/device-manager-properties-button.png" alt="The context menu for a display adapter in Device Manager, with Properties highlighted." width="500px">

   3. In Device Manager, find the device that is causing problems (you might have to expand a category), right-click on it, and click "Properties".

      <img src="./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/troubleshooting/hardware-change-restart-prompt.png" alt="The prompt to restart your computer, shown after rolling back a driver." width="500px">


Or if you can't access the normal safe mode, you may try and access Safe Mode with Command Prompt and execute the following commands in Command Prompt (replace `not_working_driver` with the driver that isn't working):

```
DISM /Image:C:\ /Get-Drivers
DISM /Image:C:\ /Remove-Driver /Driver:not_working_driver.inf
```

3. You should see something like this:  
```
Found 1 driver package(s) to remove.
Removing 1 of 1 ‚Äì not_working_driver.inf: The driver package was successfully removed.
The operation completed successfully.
```

1. At startup options, click Troubleshoot.
