## Using Malwarebytes ##
You can download Malwarebytes from [here](http://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/)
Install the program as you install a program normally and start it.
*For this guide, I'll use the free version. When you install the program you'll have a trial version of the premium version.*
### Starting a scan with Malwarebytes ###
Once **Malwarebytes** is open, you click on the **Scan** button and a scan will start.

When **nothing** has been found you can assume that your device is clean. If there is something found **place it in quarantine** and **export** the logfile.
