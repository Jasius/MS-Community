# Useful tips and "hacks" for Windows

### Get more options when right-clicking

When right-clicking on a file or folder, you can hold down shift to get more options, such as to "Copy as path" which lets you copy the path of the file.


### Windows Master Control Panel shortcut

The Windows Master Control Panel shortcut, often referred to as "God Mode", is a shortcut to access all control panel settings in one place.

To create the shortcut, create a folder and name it
```
allSettings.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}
```
The text in front of the dot has no effect.

You can now open the folder to find all control panel settings.

### Make Windows search faster

You can make the Windows Search way faster, by enabling Indexing, which indexes the locations you select. In simple words, it essentially creates a list of all files, so that when you search for a file, Windows searches in that list instead.

First, search for "Indexing Options" in the Start menu. Then, in the window that appears, click "Modify". Then, click "Show All Locations". Now, check all the locations that you want Windows to index. Finally, click Ok to confirm. Your files will now be indexed.

Keep in mind, indexing can take a long time depending on how many files it has to go through, and can take up a few resources. This will only happen once though.

### Restart GPU drivers

If your screen glitches sometimes, or your graphics are lagging, try restarting your GPU drivers using the shortcut **Win + Ctrl + Shift + B**. You will hear a beep sound, and your screen will go black for a few seconds.

You can always try a restart if that doesn't fix it.

### View more columns in the Details view in explorer

In the details view in File Explorer, you can "enable" more columns, in addition to the default ones such as Focal Length for images, or Rating for media files.

To do that, right-click on the columns in the Details view, and then choose More. You can then enable the columns you want to see by checking them.
